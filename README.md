What is this?
===
Snacka is a light weight, [RFC-6455](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455) compliant websocket client written in C. While still in development, snacka currently passes all the tests in the [Autobahn test suite](http://autobahn.ws/testsuite).

Autobahn test results are [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/stuffmatic/snacka/blob/master/doc/autobahntestresults/index.html) and API docs (work in progress) can be found [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/stuffmatic/snacka/master/doc/api/html/index.html).
